    <h1>Amazing No Cook Spinach Artichoke Dip</h1>
    <img src="dip.jpg" alt="Dip image">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dip was the result of endless combinations to try to come up with some dip that I didn't have to cook for work.
        Serve immediately or it is even better if you leave it in the refrigerator overnight. Store in nonmetallic air-tight container.
        The only kitchen utensil you need is a food processor.
        Best with pita chips, crostini, or some kind of chip with less salt.
